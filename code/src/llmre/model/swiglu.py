"""SwiGLU — a gated feed-forward network (Module 12, lesson 02).

The GPT-2 MLP (Module 5, ``llmre.model.block.MLP``) is ``Linear -> GELU ->
Linear`` with a ``4C`` hidden width. LLaMA (``papers/index.md`` #9) replaces it
with **SwiGLU**, a *gated* FFN (Shazeer 2020):

    SwiGLU(x) = ( Swish(x W_gate) ⊙ x W_up ) W_down

where ``Swish(z) = z · sigmoid(z)`` (a smooth ReLU, ``F.silu`` in PyTorch) and
``⊙`` is elementwise multiply. There are **three** weight matrices instead of
two: a ``gate`` and an ``up`` projection (both ``C -> hidden``) whose outputs are
multiplied together, then a ``down`` projection (``hidden -> C``). The elementwise
product is the "gate": the ``up`` signal is modulated by a data-dependent,
Swish-activated mask.

Because SwiGLU uses three matrices, LLaMA shrinks the hidden width to
``hidden ≈ (8/3)·C`` (often rounded to a hardware-friendly multiple) so the total
parameter count matches the ``4C`` two-matrix GELU MLP: ``3 · (8/3) = 8 = 2 · 4``.
