"""RMSNorm — Root-Mean-Square LayerNorm (Module 12, lesson 02).

LayerNorm (Module 5, ``llmre.model.block.LayerNorm``) does two things to each
length-``C`` feature vector: it **re-centers** it (subtract the mean) and
**re-scales** it (divide by the standard deviation), then applies a learned gain
and bias. RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich 2019; used by LLaMA, ``papers/index.md`` #9)
keeps only the re-scaling:

    y = x / RMS(x) · g,   RMS(x) = sqrt( mean(x²) + eps )

No mean subtraction, no bias. The observation is that the re-centering barely
matters for transformers, so dropping it is cheaper (one fewer reduction, no
subtract) and works as well in practice. The learned per-channel gain ``g``
stays.
